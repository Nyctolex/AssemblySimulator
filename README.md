# Assembly Simulator
This project is a compiler and a simulator for the fictinal processor MIPS.
# Compiler
This folder contains the compiler for the .asm file. Compiling the asm files by using the CMD and passing the exe file the following args: asm_file.asm outputfile.txt.
# Simulator
The agrument for the simulator is as followings:
sim.exe memin.txt.txt diskin.txt irq2in.txt memout.txt regout.txt trace.txt hwregtrace.txt cycles.txt leds.txt display7seg.txt diskout.txt monitor.txt monitor.yuv
# Asm files
This folder containt a few assembly examples files. Binom calculates the binom operators. Disktesk is an example for using the hard disk. Sort is an example for sorting an array using bubble sort. Triangle is and example for using the mips monitor in order to draw a triangle on the screen.

For futher information read the PDF contains the ISA documentation of the MIPS proccessor.
